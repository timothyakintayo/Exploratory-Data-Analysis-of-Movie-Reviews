## Business Problem
A movie review podcast host is producing an episode about movie review aggregators and needs data-driven insights to share with their audience. Using a Rotten Tomatoes dataset, the goal is to explore patterns and relationships in movie ratings to uncover interesting facts that would engage podcast listeners.

### Key Questions
- Rating Distribution: How do critic ratings (Tomatometer) compare to audience ratings?
- Rating Correlation: Is there a relationship between how critics and audiences rate movies?
- Runtime Impact: Does movie runtime correlate with engagement metrics like number of ratings?
- Anomaly Detection: Are there any unusual patterns or outliers in the data that tell an interesting story?
